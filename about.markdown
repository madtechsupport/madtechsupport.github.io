This is mainly a technical notes / personal documentation site we're I'm writing things down for future reference. More about the motivation for this site can be found [here]({% post_url 2023-01-03-first-post %}). I'm using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme since it it both a low cost and quick way to get started with the documentation. Also, creating documentation in this way is helping me to become more proficient in Markdown and maintain good "git hygiene" particularly when it comes to branching, and pull requests.
